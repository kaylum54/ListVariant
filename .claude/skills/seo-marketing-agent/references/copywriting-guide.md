# Copywriting Guide

Formulas and best practices for conversion-focused copy.

## Headline Formulas

### Problem-Agitation-Solution

1. Identify the problem
2. Agitate the pain
3. Present the solution

> **Problem:** "Tired of losing customers to slow load times?"
> **Agitate:** "Every second of delay costs you 7% in conversions."
> **Solution:** "Our optimization tools cut load times by 60%."

### Before-After-Bridge

1. Describe current state (Before)
2. Paint the desired state (After)
3. Show how to get there (Bridge)

> **Before:** "Spending hours on manual data entry?"
> **After:** "Imagine having that time back for strategic work."
> **Bridge:** "Our automation handles it in seconds."

### AIDA

1. **Attention** — Grab attention with a bold statement
2. **Interest** — Build interest with relevant information
3. **Desire** — Create desire by showing benefits
4. **Action** — Prompt specific action

### The 4 U's

Headlines should be:
- **Useful** — Benefit to the reader
- **Urgent** — Reason to act now
- **Unique** — Different from competitors
- **Ultra-specific** — Concrete, not vague

### Headline Templates

**How-To:**
- "How to [achieve benefit] in [timeframe]"
- "How to [achieve benefit] without [common obstacle]"
- "How [specific audience] can [achieve benefit]"

**List/Number:**
- "[Number] ways to [achieve benefit]"
- "[Number] [audience] mistakes (and how to fix them)"
- "The [number] secrets of [desirable outcome]"

**Question:**
- "Want to [achieve benefit]?"
- "Ready to [desired outcome]?"
- "What if you could [benefit] without [pain]?"

**Social Proof:**
- "Why [number] [audience] trust [product/company]"
- "Join [number] [audience] who [achieved result]"
- "The [solution] that [impressive companies] use"

**Curiosity Gap:**
- "The surprising reason [outcome happens]"
- "What [impressive company] knows about [topic]"
- "The hidden [benefit] of [product/approach]"

## Value Proposition Formulas

### Simple Value Prop

> "[Product] helps [audience] [achieve benefit] by [how it works]."

Example: "Notion helps teams organize work by combining docs, databases, and project management in one tool."

### Unique Value Prop

> "Unlike [alternative], [product] [key differentiator] so you can [benefit]."

Example: "Unlike traditional CRMs, HubSpot gives you free tools that grow with your business, so you can start selling without upfront costs."

### Quantified Value Prop

> "[Product] [action] that [quantified benefit]."

Example: "A project management tool that reduces meeting time by 50%."

## CTA Copy

### Action Words

**Strong:**
- Get
- Start
- Try
- Join
- Discover
- Claim
- Unlock
- Access

**Weak (avoid):**
- Submit
- Click here
- Learn more (overused)
- Send

### CTA Formulas

**Benefit-focused:**
> "Get [benefit]" — "Get Your Free Report"

**Action-focused:**
> "Start [action]ing" — "Start Saving Today"

**First-person:**
> "Get my [benefit]" — "Get My Free Trial"

**Urgency:**
> "[Action] now" — "Claim Your Spot Now"

**Risk-reversal:**
> "Try [product] free" — "Try It Free for 14 Days"

### Button Copy by Stage

|-------|-------------|
| Awareness | Learn More, See How It Works |
| Consideration | Get a Demo, See Pricing, Compare Plans |
| Decision | Start Free Trial, Buy Now, Get Started |
| Retention | Upgrade, Refer a Friend, Leave a Review |

## Body Copy Principles

### Keep It Scannable

- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold key phrases
- Subheadings every 2-3 paragraphs
- White space between sections

### Write for the Reader

- Use "you" more than "we"
- Focus on benefits, not features
- Address objections
- Use specific numbers
- Tell stories when appropriate

### Feature → Benefit Translation

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| 256-bit encryption | Your data stays private and secure |
| 24/7 support | Get help whenever you need it |
| Cloud-based | Access your work from anywhere |
| AI-powered | Save hours on manual tasks |
| One-click integration | Set up in minutes, not days |

### The "So What?" Test

After every statement, ask "So what?" to find the benefit:

> "Our software uses AI." → So what?
> "It automates repetitive tasks." → So what?
> "You save 10 hours per week." ← That's the benefit!

### Risk Reversal

- Free trials
- Money-back guarantees
- No credit card required
- Easy cancellation

### Reciprocity

- Free tools or resources
