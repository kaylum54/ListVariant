# Sprint Planning Guide

## Sprint Structure

Each sprint follows a predictable rhythm:

1. **Sprint Planning** (Start of sprint)
2. **Daily Standups** (Throughout)
3. **Sprint Review** (End of sprint)
4. **Retrospective** (After review)

## Sprint Planning Process

### 1. Review Backlog

Before planning, ensure the backlog is:
- Prioritized by business value
- Estimated (use story points or T-shirt sizes)
- Refined (acceptance criteria defined)

### 2. Set Sprint Goal

Define a clear, achievable goal:
- One sentence describing what success looks like
- Aligns with project vision
- Measurable

Example: "Users can sign up, log in, and reset their password."

### 3. Select Sprint Items

Pull items from the backlog based on:
- Priority (highest value first)
- Dependencies (unblock other work)
- Team capacity
- Sprint goal alignment

### 4. Task Breakdown

For each selected item:
- Break into tasks (< 4 hours each)
- Identify agent assignments
- Flag dependencies between agents

### 5. Commit

Team agrees to the sprint scope. Changes during sprint require Project Lead approval.

## Agent Assignment Matrix

| Task Type | Primary Agent | Supporting Agents |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Feature development | Senior Dev → Dev Team | Structure Agent |
| Bug fixes | Dev Team | Codebase Reviewer |
| Security hardening | Security Agent | Senior Dev |
| Landing pages | SEO & Marketing | Dev Team |
| Refactoring | Senior Dev | Structure Agent, Codebase Reviewer |
| Documentation | Documentation Agent | All (for input) |

## Capacity Planning

Consider agent availability:
- Security Agent: Best used in batches (audit sessions)
- SEO Agent: Most valuable pre-launch
- Documentation Agent: Continuous, peaks at milestones
- Dev Team: Core capacity for feature work

## Sprint Ceremonies

### Daily Standup Format

Each agent reports:
1. What was completed
2. What's in progress
3. Any blockers

### Sprint Review

Demonstrate completed work:
- Working software only
- Get stakeholder feedback
- Update backlog based on feedback

### Retrospective

Discuss:
- What went well?
- What could improve?
- Action items for next sprint
