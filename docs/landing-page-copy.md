## 4. Problem Section

### Section Heading
> Cross-listing is eating your time alive

### Description
> You find a great piece to resell. Then you spend the next 45 minutes uploading the same photos, writing the same description, and filling in the same details on platform after platform. That time adds up fast. Most UK resellers waste 5 to 10 hours a week just duplicating listings they have already created.

### Pain Point Card 1
- **Title:** Repetitive Listings
- **Description:** You copy-paste the same title, description, and price across every platform. One item can take 30+ minutes to list everywhere. That is time you should spend sourcing.

### Pain Point Card 2
- **Title:** Platform Overload
- **Description:** Each marketplace has different forms, different rules, and different image requirements. Keeping track of seven platforms means seven sets of problems.

### Pain Point Card 3
- **Title:** Missed Sales
- **Description:** Every platform you skip is a buyer you never reach. But listing everywhere manually is unsustainable. So you settle for two or three and hope for the best.

## 10. FAQ

### How does SyncSellr work?
SyncSellr combines a web dashboard with a Chrome extension. You create your listing in the dashboard, then our extension automatically fills in forms and uploads images on each marketplace. For eBay and Etsy, we use direct API connections for even faster listing.

### Which marketplaces are supported?
SyncSellr supports 7 UK marketplaces: eBay, Facebook Marketplace, Gumtree, Etsy, Vinted, Depop, and Poshmark. We are the first UK platform to include Gumtree.

### Do I need API keys?
No. For most marketplaces, our Chrome extension handles everything through browser automation. eBay and Etsy use OAuth, which means you just click "Connect" and authorise access. No developer accounts or API keys required.

### Is my data secure?
Yes. Your login credentials are never stored on our servers. The Chrome extension works locally in your browser. We use industry-standard encryption for all data in transit and at rest.

### How much does it cost?
SyncSellr is free to start with up to 10 listings and 3 marketplaces. Our Pro plan at £14.99/mo unlocks all 7 marketplaces and unlimited listings. Business plans start at £29.99/mo for teams and advanced features.

### What about Gumtree support?
SyncSellr is the first UK cross-listing tool to support Gumtree. Our Chrome extension automates the full listing process on Gumtree, including category selection, location, and image uploads. No other UK tool offers this.
